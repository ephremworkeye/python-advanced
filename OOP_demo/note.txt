# multiple inheritace 
    # python supports multipe inheritance
    # allows class to derive mulitple other classes 

# case for multiple inheritance
    # we want a new class called TemporarySecratory that begaves like a Secretary in the productivity system, but is paid as an HourlyEmployee in the a payroll system

# Method Resolution Order(MRO)
    # A set of rules that diefines the search path  that python uses when searching for a method in cases of inheritance
    # Looks like an orderd list of classes
    # Each class has its own MRO
    # used by the super() function
